# VESPA -- **V**ariant **E**ffect **S**core **P**rediction without **A**lignments

**VESPA** is a simple, yet powerful Single Amino Acid Variant (SAV) effect predictor based on embeddings of the Protein Language Model [ProtT5](https://github.com/agemagician/ProtTrans).

The single-sequence-based SAV effect prediction is set up in a multistage pipeline that includes (1) generating `ProtT5` embeddings, (2) extracting per-residue conservation predictions, (3) (optionally) extracting per-variant log-odds ratios, and (4) predicting the effect of all possible amino acid substitutions. Step (4) can be completed by either using **VESPA** with (2) and (3) as input, or by using the computationally more efficient method VESPA-light (**VESPAl**) with only step (2) as input for a small drop in prediction performance.

The specifics of **VESPA** and **VESPAl** can be found in our paper, [_Embeddings from protein language models predict conservation and variant effects_ (Marquet et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00439-021-02411-y). The performance of **VESPA** when evaluated against SOTA methods can be seen below.

## Precomputed VESPA and VESPAl predictions

Precomputed **VESPA** and **VESPAl** predictions are currently available for 39 _DMS experiments_ here:  [_Supplementary file 3 of (Marquet et al., 2021)_](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00439-021-02411-y). Furthermore, **VESPAl** predictions are available for the [_human proteome_](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5905863) (downloaded 22/01/17), and for the [__fly (drosophila melanogaster) proteome__](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6322184) (downloaded 22/03/01).

## Usage

The preferred method to install **VESPA** is via pip:

```bash
pip install vespa-effect
```

-----

### Input Files

**Required**: A single `FASTA` file containing all your wildtype sequences (note: this file can contain any number of sequences).

**Optional**: If you are only interested in a subset of possible mutations (specific mutations), you can add `-m mutations.txt` to the code line in [Quickstart](#Quickstart) (note: per default all mutations are considered). Click [`here`](#mutations-file) to head to the file format explanation of `mutations.txt`.

-----

### Quickstart

For simplicity of this guide, we will assume a folder containing all data: f.e., the `FASTA` file is placed at `data/sequences.fasta` and the (optional) `mutations.txt` at `data/mutations.txt`.

After installing the repository, you can run the following:

```bash
vespa data/sequences.fasta --prott5_weights_cache data/cache
```

By default, this runs **VESPAl** for all possible mutations. It will generate a new folder _vespa_run_directory_ in your current working directory. Within this folder you will find two files containing input features (embeddings, conservation prediction) and an _output_ folder with .csv files containing **VESPAl** predictions for each sequence with all possible mutations. More details can be found under [output](#vespa-and-vespal-output).

**WARNING** Creating embeddings requires a powerful GPU (we recommend at least 12GB of VRAM). The same applies to running **VESPA**. For more details, see [Step 1 on generating embeddings](#step-1-extracting-prott5-embeddings) and [Step 3 on extracting log-odds ratios](#step-3-log-odds-ratio-of-masked-marginal-probabilities).

**Optional**:

- If you already have precomputed embeddings available, you can use those instead of generating new ones by adding `--use_existing_embeddings` followed by the file location. Then running **VESPAl** will not require a GPU.
- If you have a GPU available you can generate **VESPA** predictions by adding `--vespa` to the code line above. After running **VESPA** you will find another file in your folder _vespa_run_directory_ containing log-odds ratios as additional input.
- `--prott5_weights_cache` followed by a folder path specifies the location of a caching folder (or preloaded ProtT5 weigths). Instead of downloading the weights for every run of **VESPA** and/or **VESPAl**, the weights will be downloaded into this folder or just reused if already present.
- In case you want to output a single [.h5 file](#.h5 files) in addition to the default .csv files with predictions, add `--h5_output` followed by the output file location. If you are only interested in an .h5 file, add `--no_csv`.

Below you can find information on how to run each step of **VESPA** and **VESPAl** individually.
Running the vespa script will automatically the substeps below for you (with the optional specifications you of your choice). Use the substeps if you are interested in a particular intermediate result.

-----

### The substeps of VESPA and VESPAl

The following steps can be run individually and for any number of sequences contained in a `FASTA` file.

#### Step 1: Extracting ProtT5 embeddings

To run **VESPA** and/or **VESPAl** to obtain SAV predictions, you will need the `ProtT5` embeddings of your sequences. If you have a GPU, you can use the included embedding script on your own machine to generate your protein embeddings:

```bash
vespa_emb data/sequences.fasta -o data/embeddings.h5  --prott5_weights_cache data/cache

```

As you can see, you need to specify an output file location (`-o`), and the `FASTA` file location of your input sequences.

**Optional**: `--prott5_weights_cache` specifies a caching directory to store `ProtT5` weights. If not present, the line above will download the weights to your current working directory for every run of **VESPA** and/or **VESPAl**.

#### Step 2: Conservation Prediction

**VESPA** and **VESPAl** take per-residue conservation predictions as input. To generate them, run the following (in the `VESPA` folder):

```bash
vespa_conspred data/embeddings.h5 -o data/conspred.h5
```

The input for our conservation predictor are the `ProtT5` embeddings. In your output file (`-o`), you will find 9-state conservation probabilities (per-residue) needed as input for the models. For more details on the conservation prediction please see the paper mentioned above.

**Optional**: In case you are interested in generating a file that contains the predicted conservation classes instead of the assigned class probabilities, add `--output_classes` above.

#### Step 3: Log-odds ratio of masked marginal probabilities

This step requires a GPU! The two models **VESPA** and **VESPAl** differ in their predictive performance but also in the required input. If you are only interested in running **VESPAl**, you can skip this step.

To generate the log-odds ratios of masked marginal probabilities required for **VESPA**, run (in the `VESPA` folder):

```bash
vespa_logodds data/sequences.fasta -o data/logodds.h5 
```

**Optional**:

- To run the log-odds script including the mutations file, add `-m data/mutations.txt` to the code line above.
- Per default the command above generates the [`.h5` file](#h5-files) required for the subsequent steps. We provide two options to output a human readable version of the log-odds scores by adding `--single_csv data/single_logodds.csv` or `--csv_dir data/csv_dir/` at the end of the code line above. The first option generates a single csv file with all sequences and SAVs. For large sets, we recommend to use the second option, which outputs multiple csv files separated by sequence ID of the given `FASTA` file. The format of the .csv files is described [below](#log-odds-ratio-output).

#### Step 4: Run **VESPA** and/or **VESPAl**

Now you have all the data required to run **VESPA** and/or **VESPAl**. Per default, the `vespa` script will predict SAV effects for **VESPAl** only. To explicitly enable **VESPA** add `--vespa` (which will run both models), and to disable **VESPAl** add `--no-vespal`. To generate predictions, execute the following code (in the `VESPA` folder):

- **Both** (if you computed the conservation prediction and the log-odds):

    ```bash
    vespa_run --vespa data/conspred_probs.h5 data/sequences.fasta --T5_input data/logodds.h5 --output predictions/
    ```

- **Only VESPA** (if you computed the conservation prediction and the log-odds):

    ```bash
    vespa_run --vespa --no-vespal data/conspred_probs.h5 data/sequences.fasta -T5_input data/logodds.h5 --output predictions/
    ```

- **Only VESPAl** (if you only computed the conservation prediction):

    ```bash
    vespa_run data/conspred_probs.h5 data/sequences.fasta --output predictions/
    ```

**Optional**: In case you want to output a single [.h5 file](#.h5 files) in addition to the default .csv files with predictions, add `--h5_output` followed by the output location. If you are only interested in an .h5 file, add `--no_csv` and drop `--output predictions/`. More details can be found under [output](#vespa-and-vespal-output).

**Note:** The format of the results file is described below at [VESPA and VESPAl output](#vespa-and-vespal-output).

### Additional Information

#### Extracting raw reconstruction probabilities

You might be interested in extracting the raw reconstruction probabilities for each mutation position from `ProtT5`. These raw reconstruction probabilities are used to calculate the log-odds ratio and is explained in more detail in the corresponding publication.
To do so, use:

```bash
vespa_logodds -r --reconstruction_output data/reconstruction_probas data/sequences.fasta -o data/logodds.h5 
```

**Optional**: Add a mutations file.

The generated datasets in the [`.h5` file](#h5-files) contain probability vectors that determine the reconstruction probabilities for all amino acids sorted according to the `MUTATION_ORDER` in `config.py`. If a particular mutation was not computed (i.e., the position was not present in the `mutation.txt`) it contains -1.

#### File Specifications

This section describes relevant file formats for **VESPA** and **VESPAl**:

##### Mutations file

A simple text file with a protein ID and one mutation per-line (i.e., mutations separated by \n for newline).
Every mutation should be specified by `<PROTEIN_ID>_<SAV-String>` separated by an underscore. The default `<SAV-String>` has the following format `<fromAA><0-basedSequencePosition><toAA>`.

The sequence ID needs to be equivalent to the one in the sequence `FASTA` file.
The SAV string has the format: `<Original Amino Acid><Position><Replacement Amino Acid>`

Example:

```txt
ENSP00000355206_I0L
ENSP00000355206_I0V
ENSP00000355206_I0L
ENSP00000355206_I0K
ENSP00000355206_I0T
```

**Optional:** In case you have a file with 1-based mutations, add the flag `--one_based_mutations`.

##### `.h5` files

Multiple scripts generate `.h5` files. These files follow the [`hdf5`-standard](https://www.hdfgroup.org/solutions/hdf5)
and can be processed in python using the library [`h5py`](https://www.h5py.org/). Generally, the files are segmented into datasets that can be accessed using the protein accession in the `FASTA` file. The datasets are explained in more detail in the respective _output sections_.

##### Conservation output

The conservation prediction will output an .h5 file with the predicted 9-state conservation probabilities. For each ID of the `FASTA` file, the respective dataset contains a matrix of size 9xL, with L being the length of the protein sequence, and 9 being the predicted conservation class (index 0 = very variable; index 8 = very conserved).

Additionally, you can extract a file with per-residue conservation class predictions for each sequence directly.

##### Log-odds ratio output

The default output is an .h5 file that contains one Lx20 matrix per sequence. -1 means no log-odds ratio was computed for the respective mutation.

When running `--single_csv data/single_logodds.csv`, the log-odds ratio output file contains all mutations (or the mutations determined by the mutations file) as `<PROTEIN_ID>_<SAV-String>`, followed by a `;` and the log-odds ratio for a particular mutation per line.

Example:

```csv
B3VI55_LIPSTSTABLE_A438Q;0.053829677402973175
B3VI55_LIPSTSTABLE_A438N;0.061238136142492294
B3VI55_LIPSTSTABLE_A438Y;0.012603843584656715
B3VI55_LIPSTSTABLE_A438M;0.012212143279612064
B3VI55_LIPSTSTABLE_A438H;0.0241163931787014
B3VI55_LIPSTSTABLE_A438W;0.004520446062088013
```

In case the predictions are written into a directory, e.g. by specifying `--csv_dir` in [Step 3](#step-3-log-odds-ratio-of-masked-marginal-probabilities), the script will create one file per sequence, named by sequence ID (note: the ID will be normalized, i.e, each special character will be replaced by `_`).
The file will contain one `<Mutation-String>;score` per-line.

Example file called `B3VI55_LIPSTSTABLE`:

```csv
A438Q;0.053829677402973175
A438N;0.061238136142492294
A438Y;0.012603843584656715
A438M;0.012212143279612064
A438H;0.0241163931787014
A438W;0.004520446062088013
```

##### VESPA and VESPAl output

The default output of **VESPA** and/or **VESPAl** will generate one .csv (with semicolon separator) file per protein in the output folder of `vespa_run_directory`. If you specified an output directory with `--output`, you will find the .csv (with semicolon separator) files there.
To circumvent naming issues due to long sequence ID's, the csv files will be numbered by sequence occurrence in the `FASTA` file. A lookup file `map.json` will be created in the output directory containing a dictionary mapping from number to sequence ID.

Example `map.json`:

```json
{    "0": "B3VI55_LIPSTSTABLE",
    "1": "BF520_ENV",
    "2": "BG_STRSQ",
    "3": "BG505_ENV",
    "4": "HG_FLU",
    "5": "MTH3_HAEAESTABILIZED"}
```

The individual files will contain rows with the mutations (format: `<fromAA><0-basedSequencePosition><toAA>`) along with the respective predictions of **VESPA** and/or **VESPAl**.

Example `0.csv`:

```csv
Mutant;VESPAl;VESPA
M0A;0.4457732174287125;0.3520255108578212
M0L;0.3191178420567241;0.2717188481387661
M0G;0.5355136080284415;0.4110670843315182
M0V;0.3594337197937546;0.2971971641898669
M0S;0.4457732174287125;0.35202555423053
M0R;0.4457732174287125;0.35202621644931126
```

If you chose to generate an .h5 output, the ID's will be the original `FASTA` ID's. The file contains one 20xL-shaped matrix per sequence-ID. L is the length of the respective protein length, and 20 is the possible number of amino acid variants (including self). The order of amino acids is determined by `MUTANT_ORDER` in `predict/config.py` (`ALGVSREDTIPKFQNYMHWC`). Empty fields that were not calculated/specified (f.e., wildtype substitutions) contain a -1.
