Variant Effect Score Prediction without Alignments

Repository for the pre-trained model VESPA and its faster version VESPA-light (VEPSAl): given a protein sequence as input, the models predict single amino acid variant effect scores.
For more information check the preprint ["Embeddings from protein language models predict conservation and variant effects"](10.21203/rs.3.rs-584804/v1), which is under consideration at Human Genetics.
